# TODO

A list of things to do that could make this generated code more useful:

* Add identity_domain_id definition to `lib/Configuration.php`
* Add service_id definition to `lib/Configuration.php`
* Remove the x_id_tenant_name requirement (will do by fixing swagger definitions)
* Figure out why the test cases are all empty
* Fix issue where defining a host is assumed, as otherwise https://localhost is used and `lib/Configuration.php` is ignored (filed a swagger_codegen bug for this)
* Determine if the SwaggerClient-php/ root dir should be kept
